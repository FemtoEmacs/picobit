	  Code may be shrinked by omitting arbitrary
	  precision bignums.

	config BIGNUM_FIXED
		bool "Fixed 24-bit"
		help
		  A very small bignum implementation which has a fixed
		  precision. Currently it is only useful on 8-bit targets,
		  and bignums are 24 bit long.
		  

	config BIGNUM_LONG
		bool "Arbitrary"
		help
		  Arbitrary precision bignums are represented by lists of
		  16-bit values, and computations are performed by helper
		  functions.
